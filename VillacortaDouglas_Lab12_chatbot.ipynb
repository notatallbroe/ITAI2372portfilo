        " 1. What is a chatbot? A chatbot (a robot that chats with human beings) is an application that generates a conversation with a user.\n",
        " 2. Types of chatbots:\n",
        "        - Button based: The most basic chatbot that interacts with the user by cliking on buttons.\n",
        "        - Rule-based: A simple chatbot that interacts with logical rules of if-then. It is based on simple FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions).\n",
        "        - AI-powered: It is a type of rule-based bot that is backed by AI predefined options for questions and answers. This type is equipped with AI and NLU (Natural Language Understanding).\n",
        "        - Generatice AI: These types of bots are relatively advanced and they are based on LLM (Large Language Models) with high-quality texts, images, and sound.\n",
        "        - Retrieval-based Chatbot: This type is the opposite of generative AI-based chatbot. Data is not generated by AI instantaneously; but has already been created and it will only be retrieved by the chatbot in response to the user's question\n",
        "        - Voice Enabled Chatbot: This type of chatbot runs a conversation with a user by speaking to the user rather than typing.\n",
        "        - Hybrid: A hybrid chatbot combines rule-based, ML models and logic; and integration of AI technologies.\n"

        "  1. For the begining of the chatbot lab we needed to define what kind of chatbot we would make and landed on the retrival based chatbot.\n",
        "  2. We used a corpus that we created for the responses the chatbot would be using.\n",
        "  3. I had an issue at step three where we fed the chatbot the data. I wanted to try something new and broke the syntax of the nested pairs_QnA method.\n",
        "  4. I then went ahead and broke the bot by not entering a breakout or response for it to stop.\n",
        "  5. I fixed the issue I had with the bot not responding to me creating a new set of keys as there was a typo not letting it break out of the while loop.\n",
        "  6. There was a simple \"None\" response when the chatbot didn't have the correct response for what the user said. I wonder if we can hook up an ml to come up with stuff on the spot.\n",
        "  7. I thought it would be nice to name my chatbot golden_retrival_chatbot because, golden retrievers are known for coming back and that is all this chatbot does; retrieve.\n",
        "  8. I found out too while doing this lab that there's such a lab as reflections which are just responses and their answers which is genius for NLP to have open-source.\n",
        "  9. Overall the chatbot creation was easy I wish I knew what guide professor De Bary used because it was so simple to follow and complete contrary to what I believe.\n",
        "  10. All we have for the chat to end is a simple while loop which says if the users says one of these 3 words please stop the retrival model basically, I wonder what a company like OpenAI uses for breakout from the model.\n",
        "  11. This model isn't as smart as I thought it would be however, we then again only spent three hours on it.\n",
        "  12. We can connect this to a web server and from there expose it to the internet so they can make it smarter and heavier for free pretty much.\n",
        "  13. Wwe did not split the corpus into test and training data so it won't get smarter.\n",
        "  14. This is more of like a super advanced poor-mans chatgpt because we know the responses we are going to get ahead of time.\n",
        "  15. We need to make this chatbot better by making it extremely smart and faster than anybody else's.\n",
